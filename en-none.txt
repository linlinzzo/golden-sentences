Nothing is impossible to a willing heart.
Where there is a will there is a way.
The longest journey begins with the first step.
Every little helps.
Pride hurts, modesty benefits.
Nothing is to be got without pain but poverty.
Rome was not built in a day.
Lost years are worse than lost dollars.
God helps those who help themselves.
More haste, less speed.
One minute on the stage needs ten years practice off stage.
Well begun is half done.
Good wine needs no bush.
Industry is the parent of success.
Great minds think alike.
Practice makes perfect.
Still waters run deep.
Little stone fell great oaks.
